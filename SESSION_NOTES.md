# Session Notes

Use this file as persistent project memory between chats.
Keep entries short, specific, and current.

## Project Snapshot
- **Current Goal:** Core ball gameplay first: stable grab/drop/throw before animation polish.
- **Current Branch:** `main` (tracking `origin/main`).
- **Build/Run Status:** s&box opens and scripts compile. Multiplayer grab/drop/throw still works. Ball size was increased (`main_ball` scale `0.4`) and passive push anti-abuse tuning is active in `CatchUpSpeedBoost` (`BallPushBlockRadius=30`, `BallPushApproachDot=0.1`). Major unresolved blocker remains: first-contact client solidity inconsistency until first grab/drop cycle.
- **Last Updated:** 30/04/26 (late session)

## Important Decisions
- **Keep `BallGrab` as the source of truth for hold state.**
  - Why: One owner of state avoids desync bugs between multiple scripts.
  - Date: 2026-04-28
- **Split throw into a separate `BallThrow` component.**
  - Why: Better organization, easier debugging, cleaner future animation integration.
  - Date: 2026-04-28
- **Use optional direct ball reference (`MainBall`) with name fallback (`MainBallName`).**
  - Why: Direct reference is safer; name fallback keeps flexibility.
  - Date: 2026-04-28
- **Use host-approved RPC flow for grab/drop/throw in multiplayer.**
  - Why: Prevents client-side state divergence and keeps one source of gameplay truth.
  - Date: 2026-04-29
- **Use startup scene `scenes/throwdown_prototype.scene` with `GameNetworkManager` active.**
  - Why: Local multi-window networking tests require the correct gameplay scene and per-connection player spawning.
  - Date: 2026-04-29
- **Keep cosmetics sync in a dedicated visual component (`PlayerCosmeticsSync`) instead of `GameNetworkManager`.**
  - Why: Isolates visual/avatar timing logic from network spawn authority to avoid multiplayer spawn regressions.
  - Date: 2026-04-30
- **Use `ClothingContainer.CreateFromConnection(ownerConnection, false)` for remote cosmetics apply.**
  - Why: Remote clients may not have ownership verification for other players; `removeUnowned=true` can strip valid cosmetics.
  - Date: 2026-04-30
- **Lock player/clothing LOD after cosmetics apply (`LodOverride = 0`).**
  - Why: Prevents camera-distance/angle skin tone and cosmetic visual glitches caused by LOD transitions.
  - Date: 2026-04-30
- **Keep experimental ball push/lock systems scoped and removable.**
  - Why: Several anti-push experiments caused regressions; keep core grab/throw stable while iterating.
  - Date: 2026-04-30

## Constraints and Rules
Only include constraints that are easy to forget and expensive to violate.

- Engine/version constraints: s&box component workflow; compile errors can hide components from inspector list.
- Performance constraints: Keep gameplay logic simple for now; no heavy systems needed yet.
- Code style/conventions: Beginner-readable names, short methods, one source of truth for state.
- Tooling/workflow constraints: After script edits, allow recompile/restart editor if component does not appear.
- Networking constraints: Ball gameplay state is host-authoritative; avoid client-only gameplay mutation paths.
- Cosmetics/visual constraints: Keep avatar/cosmetics apply logic visual-only and isolated from spawn authority components.
- Refactor safety constraint: Mark cleanup chats as `refactor-only, no behavior change intended`, keep scope to 1-2 files, and run quick regression checks after.

## Network-Safe Rules (Always Apply)
Treat these as mandatory implementation rules for all new gameplay features.

1. **Authority first (before coding):**
   - Decide who owns truth for gameplay outcomes (default: host/server).
   - Do not let clients finalize gameplay outcomes.
2. **Input is a request, not a result:**
   - Client sends action request to host (for example tackle, grab, throw).
   - Host validates and applies final result.
3. **Sync final gameplay state:**
   - Sync authoritative end states (`IsHolding`, `IsRagdolled`, cooldown state, etc.).
   - Do not rely on local-only gameplay booleans for shared truth.
4. **Separate gameplay and visuals:**
   - Gameplay logic must be authoritative and replicated.
   - Client-only effects/animations are fine, but must not decide outcomes.
5. **2-window validation is required before done:**
   - Host action visible correctly on client.
   - Client action visible correctly on host.
   - Rapid repeat/spam test.
   - At least one edge case (jump/mid-air/moving fast/timing overlap).

### Feature Build Pattern (Use Every Time)
1. Define authority and synced state fields first.
2. Implement host RPC request flow for actions.
3. Apply outcomes on host only, then replicate/sync.
4. Add minimal visual handling after gameplay sync is stable.
5. Run multiplayer checklist before marking feature complete.

## Collaboration Preferences
- Experience level: Beginner (new to development).
- Communication style: Explain steps in simple language, avoid jargon where possible, and include quick "what/why" context for commands and changes.
- Reminder: If naming confusion/repeated renames starts happening, propose expanding Naming Canon (especially before team size or system count grows).

## Known Issues / Risks
- [ ] MUST SOLVE: client sees ball as non-solid on first interaction (can walk/jump into it) until first grab+drop cycle.
  - Impact: High exploit risk and inconsistent game feel; clients can generate unfair ball movement before normalization.
  - Owner: Max
  - Next action: Implement a reliable per-client first-contact solid-state fix that works before any pickup/drop (treat as blocking issue before release).
- [ ] Throw tuning still placeholder (force/arc may need balancing).
  - Impact: Throw feel may be too strong/weak depending on map and movement speed.
  - Owner: Max
  - Next action: Tune `ThrowForce`, `ThrowUpForce`, and `ThrowStartOffset` in inspector playtests.
- [ ] While charging throw, walk/run animations can still play in place even though movement is locked.
  - Impact: Mechanics are correct, but visual polish is rough during charge.
  - Owner: Max
  - Next action: Handle with explicit charge/throw animation states in animation pass.
- [ ] Future animation integration not done yet.
  - Impact: Visual quality lower for now, but mechanics are playable.
  - Owner: Max
  - Next action: Add throw/run-holding animations after mechanics lock-in.
- [ ] Multiplayer still needs broader stress testing (rapid pickup/drop/throw spam, jump-drop edge cases, longer sessions).
  - Impact: Core behavior is much better, but edge desync risk remains until stress tests pass repeatedly.
  - Owner: Max
  - Next action: Run 2-window multiplayer consistency pass for 15-20 minutes and log any repro steps.
- [ ] Free-ball collision feel on client still not equal to host feel.
  - Impact: Ball is largely consistent across screens, but client contact feels less direct/smooth than host contact.
  - Owner: Max
  - Next action: Tune/iterate free-ball client visual follow settings and validate with repeatable push tests from multiple angles.
- [ ] Need one fresh regression pass after cosmetics + LOD stabilization commit.
  - Impact: Main flows are passing, but one clean verification pass helps catch any side effects before moving to new features.
  - Owner: Max
  - Next action: Run 2-3 player session and validate pickup/drop/throw, cosmetics visibility, and camera-distance render stability for 10+ minutes.

## Current Plan (Top 3)
1. Solve the MUST-SOLVE client first-contact ball solidity bug (client can walk/jump into ball until first grab/drop).
2. Keep grab/throw stable while deciding final design for passive push (likely disabled or heavily limited until kick exists).
3. Add intentional kick mechanic later as the reliable way to move free ball via player action.

## Proven Fix Recipes (Reuse)
Use these when the same symptom appears again.

### Client Free-Ball Jitter (Host looks good, client looks floaty/jittery)
**Symptom**
- Host sees natural bounces, client sees rapid up/down jitter or floaty correction (especially jump-apex drop tests).

**What actually fixed it**
1. Keep host as full gameplay/physics authority (`BallGrab` remains source of truth).
2. In `BallClientFeel`, disable local free-ball physics/collision on owning client during free-ball visual follow (prevent local physics fighting host corrections).
3. Buffer recent host snapshots on client (`position`, `rotation`, timestamp) and render from delayed buffered target (`InterpolationDelay`) instead of chasing latest transform each frame.
4. Avoid double smoothing: when buffered target is available, render directly from buffered interpolation result.
5. Add velocity-aware interpolation path (snapshot linear velocity + Hermite position interpolation) to better preserve bounce/throw arc shape.

**What did NOT help enough**
- Tuning only `FreeBallVisualFollowSharpness` / `ContactBoostSharpness` / `ContactBoostDuration` without changing interpolation approach.
- Hard snap thresholds for normal motion (reduced one jitter pattern but made roll/push look framey/teleporty).

**Validation path**
- 2+ windows.
- Repeat exact apex jump-drop test and normal run/push test from same start point.
- Confirm host/client ball path similarity improved without introducing framey motion.

## Component Missing Recovery (s&box)
If a component (for example `BallThrow`) does not appear in Add Component:

1. Save all scripts.
2. Wait for script compile to finish.
3. Try Add Component search again with exact name.
4. Recompile scripts once (or trigger project refresh).
5. If still missing, restart s&box/editor.
6. After restart, confirm no compile errors before adding component.

## Next Chat Kickoff
Paste this at the start of a new session:

`Read SESSION_NOTES.md first, continue from Current Plan, and propose any needed updates before coding.`

## End-of-Session Handoff
Update this checklist before ending a chat:

- What changed: Split client-side feel/smoothing code out of `BallGrab` into new `BallClientFeel`. `BallGrab` now focuses on host-authoritative grab/drop/hold state and RPC flow. Scene now includes `BallClientFeel` with tuning properties for free-ball responsiveness.
- What is still blocked: MUST-SOLVE client first-contact ball solidity inconsistency (before first grab/drop) and related exploit risk.
- Exactly what to do next: Repro in fresh host + 2 clients without any pickup first, instrument/log first-contact ball state on host/client, and implement a deterministic pre-interaction normalization that does not require pickup/drop to stabilize.
